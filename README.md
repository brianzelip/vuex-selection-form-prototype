# vuex-selection-form-prototype

Sandbox space for getting Vuex working in the context of a form that presents a list of items that a user can select/deselect.

Made in response to getting stuck in my [groceries-vue repo](https://github.com/brianzelip/groceries-vue).

Built from scratch using Parcel Bundler with only the minimal amount of node modules.
